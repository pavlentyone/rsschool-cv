        <p>Html gives you an opportunity to use both quotes ' and ". Enjoy it!</p>
        <span title="You've done it! Congrats)">Every HTML element can have a title. This is possible because the title attribute is general. So there is other general attributes to use in you custom elements! Try it here.</span>
        <span style="display: block;" align="center">If you want to center an element you should use align attribute. Unfortunately, it works just with block elements... so use "display: block" in your element if it is a line one</span>
        <div style="text-align: center;">By the way, I don't recommend you to use align attribute. HTML built to make a clean an understandable DOM tree or Document Object Model. This is why any style changes should be done in attached CSS! But use it in a block element</div>
        <center>
            <span>This text is in the center tag</span>
        </center>
        <span>Default align is left!</span>
        <span title="Yeah">There is a lot of general attributes you can us wuth any tag. For example, title</span>
